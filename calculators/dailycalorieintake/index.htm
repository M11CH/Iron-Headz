      <h1>DAILY CALORIE INTAKE</h1>
      <p>Your daily calorie intake is the amount of calories your body requires to maintain its normal
	functionality. There are many factors which contribute to the amount calories needed, such as
	the size of your body, your age and the frequency and intensity of your training. Your daily
	calorie intake or the total daily energy expenditure(TDEE) is how many calories your body uses
	each day. With this number, you are able to determine how many calories you should be consuming
	based on your fitness goal.
	<br><br>
	Calculate your calorie intake:</p>
      
      <p> Although this calculator is a great tool, it's not perfect. Keep in mind this is just an estimate.
	Furthermore, many of us overestimate, underestimate, or flat-out lie about how much we weigh or
	exercise. Even if you were honest with the calculator, it doesn't mean the number will be 100 percent
	accurate. Whatever number the TDEE calculator gave to you is a starting point - not a law for you to
	abide for the rest of your life.</p>
